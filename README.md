## Project Overview
Neighborhood Map is a single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood(Wayne,NJ) and the highlighted bakery shops in my neighborhood.

Functionalities included:
* Display Map Markers based on the locations on page load.
* List view of those locations and an input text field to filter locations and displaying those filtered locations on map.
* Selecting a location via list item or map marker cause the map marker to bounce.
* Third-party API(Foursquare) to provide photos when a map marker or list view entry is clicked.

## Prerequisites

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

* **Npm** is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

* **Yarn** is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.  [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
